# Why writing is important for children

Writing can mean different things to different people.
Some people find it makes them at peace.
Other people find it makes them money.
Ask a child and all you'll hear are complaints and groans.
Yet there is no denying, that writing is an essential part of all our lives, from writing emails to your teacher to posting on a forum;
writing is important for us all - children and adults.

Writing is an important part of any child's education. Across the world, children are required to write essays as an integral part of their curriculum. As a student myself, I hate writing, but I can see the wisdom in it.

Writing is an essential skill for children, as it further enables their ability to express themselves, and develop their creativity and it improves their handwriting too!
Writing is a lifelong skill that is important for personal and professional success, it is important to start early and nurture it throughout a child's life.
