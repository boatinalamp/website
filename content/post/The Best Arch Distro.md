# Installing Archcraft
## Download
First visit https://archcraft.io and download the iso file. (I recommend github download)
Then Visit https://etcher.io or https://balena.io/etcher and download balena etcher.
## Flashing to usb drive
Open Balena Etcher and select the iso file, then put in a usb drive (6gb or above) and press "Flash"
## Booting from usb
After its done flashing, Your usb is ready to boot from.
reboot your computer, and press the key to enter bios. If you dont know which key to press, just google your manufactorers details.
after entering the boot menu, select USB-Archcraft or anything with the word "usb" or "Archcraft"
## Installation
After thats done just boot into the usb, open the GUI-INSTALLER, and fill in your credentials. Archcraft supplies a dual boot option called "Shrink Partition and install"
just select that.
# Done, thats it. Enjoy Archcraft (I use arch btw)
