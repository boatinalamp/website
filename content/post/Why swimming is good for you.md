If you haven't gone swimming at least once in your life, you have no idea what you're missing out on.

Swimming builds endurance and increases your overall stamina and height. On top of all this, it makes you taller too!
Because of the way swimming works, you end up using muscles that you didn't even know existed. Swimming also helps you tone muscles and build up your general balance.
Swimming is also believed to alleviate stress or improve flexibility, coordination, and balance.

A lot of people use swimming as muscle therapy for their various injuries, like my dad, who had an ACL tear and used to swim with me as exercise.Â 
# Getting started with swimming

Getting started with swimming is easy, all you need are goggles, a cap, and swimming trunks.
It's a sport for all ages, whether you know how to swim or not.
And always remember to make sure the environment you're in is completely safe.

I would recommend going to a swim academy if it is your first time swimming, as they would have lifeguards and coaches.

It's also pretty easy to get cut while swimming, so be mindful of your surroundings.
Incidentally, my dad got his ACL knee-deep on a beach.
A lot of people do find swimming a perfect way to relax.

# If it's your first time swimming

If it's your first time swimming, I would recommend you let go of your fear and just jump into the pool.
I also would try to just get a hang of how the water feels.
